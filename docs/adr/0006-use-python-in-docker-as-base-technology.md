# Use Python in Docker as base technology

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2022-03-21

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide on a single base technology to implement the workflow.

## Decision Drivers

* Project members know Python

## Considered Options

* Python >= 3.10
* Java

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Python 3.10", because all project members know Python well enough

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Python >= 3.10

* Good, because Pattern matching
* Bad, because Not massively backwards-compatible
